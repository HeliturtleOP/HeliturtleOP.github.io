									<h1>Demo:<br />
									3D Rule Tile</h1>
									<p>The Unity game engine conveniently provides a “rule tile” system for automatically setting
										the correct orientation of tiles on a tilemap. My problem was that I wanted a type of rule
										tile for 3D objects, which as far as I can tell was not a feature included in the engine.
										The following is a detailed account of what I developed and how I developed it to solve
										my little problem.
									</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Now to begin, I would like to highlight the fact that a 3D rule tile might be a slight misnomer for what I developed. What I wanted was a rule tile that uses 3D tiles instead of 2D ones. The system still operates on a 2D plane but I did have to develop my own way of correctly setting each tile myself.</p>
								<p>The first thing I had to do was create a set of models for each possible tile permutation. I did this by drawing out the tiles pixel grid and subsequently making a model for each one in blender.</p>
								<p>Then in the unity game engine, I put together a scriptable object. The purpose of a scriptable object is to be an object that can store variables, in my case I was storing the models for each permutation in this object so it would be easier to quickly switch between different tilesets.</p>
								<p>After that I had to take a quick detour; I needed a system to place the tiles within my scene. I decided on using black and white images where white pixels represent a full tile, and black tiles represent empty ones. I also ended up making a system for randomly generating these black-and-white tile maps. My original system was based on an old blog post from the Vlambeer games studio before I ended up changing it to a system that used Perlin noise while clamping the values to black or white based on a threshold.</p>
								<p>I also later added a way to transition between different tilesets on the tile map based on the shade of gray the pixels were on the unclamped Perlin noise.</p>
